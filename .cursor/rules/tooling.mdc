### MANDATORY PROJECT RULES

#### Environment Management

- ALWAYS use both `bun` and `npm` for dependency management
- ALWAYS use `bun` for commands and task execution, you can ignore `npm` other than dependency management
- ALL commands must be run from project root (where `package.json` exists)

#### Development Workflow

- Use tools from `package.json` for everything – linting, internationalization, translation keys, rebuilding, tests (if any), etc.
- Always run lint using `bun` before commits and at the end of tasks / plan chapters
- Bun scripts set up their environments, so there's nothing extra that you need to do

#### Project Structure

- Version is managed through the `version` property of the `package.json` file
- You can see the CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows` directory
- It's best to base API implementation on API docs. If you don't have any, ask for them

#### LLM/AI Rules

- Never write plans or walkthroughs unless the user specifically asks you to
- Never assume anything. Ask validating questions. Sync with the user to validate your assumptions. Optimize for accuracy, not speed
- Only operate on verified facts. For every code change or idea you want to introduce, verify via code search if it will make sense
- Consistency is key. Look at coding patterns in and around the file you are editing as if you have OCD
- If there are any tests, those must run offline. Write tests only if the unit is simply testable. If the unit requires extensive mocking, advise the user before proceeding
- Unless explicitly asked, you should not build plans or walkthrough documents – default to keeping it short and simple, in the chat
